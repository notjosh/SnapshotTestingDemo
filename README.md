# Snapshot Testing Demo

Quick demo/s of snapshot testing. Dive into [ios-snapshot-test-case](https://github.com/facebook/ios-snapshot-test-case) for all of the real meat. Then take a look at wrappers like [ios-snapshot-test-case-expecta](https://github.com/dblock/ios-snapshot-test-case-expecta) or [Nimble-Snapshots](https://github.com/ashfurrow/Nimble-Snapshots) for matcher bridges out to Quick/Nimble & Specta/Expecta. (This project uses the former.)
